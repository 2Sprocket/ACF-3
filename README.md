Armored Combat Framework (ACF) is an addon for Garry's Mod that implements a damage system for props and players, while also providing entities and tools to build fairly realistic armored combat vehicles. Players may choose from an array of guns, ammo types, crates for fuel and ammo, engines, transmissions and more while armoring their contraptions for combat.

Ammunition is customizable with varying ballistic performance along with armor being customizable for protection against various threats. ACF is intended to be balanced for multiplayer and competitive use but there is, of course, nothing wrong with blasting some NPCs.

> ACF requires these additional addons in order to function properly

Prop Protection with [CPPI](http://ulyssesmod.net/archive/CPPI_v1-3.pdf) is not required, but highly recommended. We'd recommend Nadmod PP ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=159298542) or [Github](https://github.com/Nebual/NadmodPP)).
